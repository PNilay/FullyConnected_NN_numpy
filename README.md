# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification with Fully Connected Neural Network

This project implements a fully connected neural network using only NumPy to correctly classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to demonstrate a basic neural network implementation and showcase its ability to accurately recognize handwritten numbers.

## Overview
The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large number of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and their corresponding labels. This project aims to build and train a neural network to predict the correct digit from an input image.

## Features
- **Fully Connected Neural Network**: The project implements a feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.

- **NumPy**: NumPy is the primary library used for numerical operations. The entire neural network is implemented using NumPy, making it a pure Python solution without relying on deep learning frameworks.

- **Training and Evaluation**: The neural network is trained on the MNIST training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy in digit classification.

- **Forward Propagation and Backpropagation**: The project covers the fundamental concepts of forward propagation to make predictions and backpropagation for updating weights during training.
